            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <p>
              Playing Cards Against Development is simple. Each round, one player becomes the "Card Czar" and reads a question or a fill-in-the-blank statement from a black card. The other players choose the funniest white card from their hand to complete the sentence, and the Card Czar picks the winner. The goal? To create the most outrageous, hilarious, and politically incorrect combinations!
